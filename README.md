## How I started
In this project, I understood that I would need to create an array of objects that held onto the keys to the Question, Answers, and the Correct Answer. I found this a difficult task, as I had originally intended for my array to be a JSON version. After creating my array, I needed to create a timer, which was one of the main hurdles 
at the beginning of the project.

## My main hurdles
My main hurlde in this project was that I still have the mindset of a University student. As a University student, to use resources for my papers, I would have needed to cite my information as to not plageris. With this project, I was told thatI would need to do a lot of research in accomplishing my goals. However, when I would research, as an example, to make a timer. I would constantly be hesitant to use the varies examples for my project. In my mindset, using the examples from the internet would not be transformative, even if I do make changes to the code. As it would consitute plagersim (in my thoughts).

## What I had learned from this challenge
From this project, I learned to be less harsh to myself. As when talking to my peers, and instructors/TA's. When doing my research to solve a problem that I had, using additional resources such as snippets of code is acceptable. Especially when understanding how code functions and transforming them.

As when researching Javascript, I learned that it was made within 10 days. When hearing this, I was disappointed about how long it took to complete this assignment. After accepting that they had more experience in coding than I do, I shouldn't be comparing myself to those who do.

## If I had more time into the near future, I would like to apply more effort into the CSS and buttons
